							Unparalleled Pricing Transparency and Affordability at Canadian
							Pharmacy
						</h2>
						<p>
							Our pricing model is straightforward and transparent: our cost
							plus a 15% markup, plus any pharmacy fees. For example, our cost
							for Albendazole is $26.08 per course. After adding the 15% markup
							to cover operational costs and investments in disrupting the drug
							pricing for as many medications as possible, the base price
							becomes $30. We then add the actual cost of $3.00 that our
							pharmacy partners charge to prepare and provide your prescription.
							This results in a final price of $33, significantly lower than
							what’s available in the market. All our products follow this
							pricing structure, ensuring complete transparency.
